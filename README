Not suitable for general inclusing in Cacti because I've gone and done them
in Python.  I may revisit at some point, redo these in PHP and attempt to submit
them to SVN.  Until then, they live in GIT.

Use as you wish, attributions appreciated.

# cacti_aggr_graph.py
Alternative to the Aggreg8 plugin.  Overloads the title_cache field for graphs to
allow a cron job based invocation to automatically regenerate aggregate graphs.

# cacti_build-templates.py
Takes a name:value outputting data collection script, and generates a data source,
and one or more sets of data and graph templates.  Does not yet support indexed
queries, but it still takes a lot of the grunt work out of large graph sets.

# cacti_metrics.py
Queries Cacti as a data warehouse.  Alternative to DSStats.
--cmdb, --product, --purpose, --environment flags included as an example for how to
integrate with a CMDB.
